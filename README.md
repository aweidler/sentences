# sentences
This software will tag all of the parts of speech for each word in an English sentence.
It was developed for CS410: Text Information Systems on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/ "Coursera").
This software uses additional libraries by [Percy Wegmann](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pos "Percy Wegmann") on NPM to assist with the sentence tagging. 
All code is a part of the GNU General Public License.

Enter a sentence in the space provided then click "Evaluate!" to tag the words in the sentence.
There may be some errors but the tagger will do the best job it can to place each word into the proper part-of-speech category.

A demo can be accessed [here](http://www.austinweidler.com/sentences "http://www.austinweidler.com/sentences").
Select "Click to Start" then try the sentence "I went to the store." in the textfield. Finally, click "Evaluate!" to tag the sentence.
